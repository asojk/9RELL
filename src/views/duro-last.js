						Check out some of the key benefits fo Duro-Last roofing below and
						contact us today for a free estimate. Custom Prefabricated For Every
						Building Every Duro-Last project is prefabricated to fit every
						building roof precisely. By performing 80-85% of membrane seaming in
						our controlled factory environment, Duro-Last reduces the potential
						for rooftop installation errors and leaks that can occur with other
						systems. Also, custom fabricated stacks and curb flashings eliminate
						nearly 100% of rooftop labor from the most critical roof areas –
						transitions and changes of plane. The Duro-Last roofing system is
						perfect for any new or retrofit project, on building with flat roofs
						or low-sloped roofs. Durable The Duro-Last single-ply roofing system
						is resistant to fire, chemicals, grease, high winds and punctures,
						and easily accommodates wide temperature extremes. Duro-Last’s
						custom flashing resists ponding water and helps solve roof problems
						before they happen. Once installed, a Duro-Last roof is watertight
						and virtually maintenance-free. Installation Without Disrupting
						Building Operations Installation is quiet and safe, without loud
						machinery, hazardous materials, noxious fumes, hot tar, or mess. A
						new Duro-Last single-ply roof system can often be installed over an
						existing roof without an expensive tear-off, virtually eliminating
						debris that could disrupt building activities or damage sensitive
						equipment. Environmentally Responsible Duro-Last is proud to be a
						charter partner in the EPA ENERGY STAR® Roof Products Program.
						Duro-Last is also a charter member of the Cool Roof Rating Council
						and a member of the US Green Building Council. Our white cool roof
						membrane starts out with 87% reflectivity and is highly-reflective
						throughout its life span on the roof, saving significant energy and
						money for building owners and managers all over North America.
						Backed By Industry’s Best Warranties Duro-Last protects building
						with a comprehensive 15-year No Dollar Limit (NDL) warranty that
						clearly states our coverage of consequential damages that result
						from defects in the Duro-Last material and/or installation
						workmanship. Duro-Last also has 20-year warranties available. Code
						Compliant Duro-Last has met or exceeded all major fire and wind code
						requirements, as well as regional approvals throughout the country,
						reinforcing Duro-Last’s leadership in providing the consistent
						watertight integrity that building owners expect. The Duro-Last
						single-ply roofing system has been approved by the International
						Building Code (IBC) and meets Miami-Dade building codes.

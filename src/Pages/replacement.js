					signs that it's time for a replacement
				</span>
				<p className="replace-text">
					It can be hard to know when itâ€™s time to get a new flat roof, and
					certainly, it can be quite an investment. What is even more costly,
					though, is not replacing a damaged roof which can lead to further
					issues and even more expenses. If you experience any of the signs
					below, it may be time to schedule your flat roof replacement:
					<ul>
						<br></br>
						<li>Multiple roof holes</li>
						<li>Leaking ceiling</li>
						<li>Torn vapor barrier</li>
						<li>Missing pieces of roof</li>
						<li>Pooling water</li>
					</ul>
					<br></br>
					The only way to be sure if your roof is still in good shape is to hire
					a professional. Contact Grell today for a free roofing inspection to
					see if a roof replacement is the next step for maintaining your
					building.

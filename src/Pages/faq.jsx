                            <p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) roofing, is a single-ply membrane used on flat or low-sloped roof surfaces.
                                PVC roofing systems are typically comprised of two layers of PVC film and a fabric scrim that
                                provides strength and durability. While available in a wide range of colors, white PVC roofs offer
                                superior reflectivity compared to darker roofing systems, and PVC roofs are effective in all
                                climates. Additionally, PVC membranes are flexible, lightweight, resistant to most chemicals, and
                                self-extinguish after fire exposure. To learn more about the benefits of PVC roofing, as well as the

      <p className="replace-text">
        Whether from faulty installation, storm damage, or simply an outdated
        roofing system, there are a variety of reasons you may need a flat roof
        repair. Signs of damage are not always obvious, either, which is why
        it’s important to get a professional roof inspection to uncover even the
        smallest of damage on your roof. Some common signs you may need a flat
        roof repair include:
        <ul>
          <li>Pooling water</li>
          <li>Flashing separation</li>
          <li>Membrane rips</li>
          <li>Coating cracks</li>
          <li>Loose or missing fasteners</li>
          <li>Roof or ceiling leaks</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        If you are experiencing any of the issues above or even another type of
        problem with your flat roof, contact us today for a free inspection.

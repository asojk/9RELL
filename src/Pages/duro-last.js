It’s a worthwhile investment to protect your building. Check out some of the key benefits of Duro-Last roofing below and contact us today for a free estimate. Custom Prefabricated For Every Building Every Duro-Last project is prefabricated to fit every building roof precisely. By performing 80-85% of membrane seaming in our controlled factory environment, Duro-Last reduces the potential for rooftop installation errors and leaks that can occur with other systems. Also, custom fabricated stacks and curb flashings eliminate nearly 100% of rooftop labor from the most critical roof areas – transitions and changes of plane. The Duro-Last roofing system is perfect for any new or retrofit project, on building with flat roofs or low-sloped roofs. Durable The Duro-Last single-ply roofing system is resistant to fire, chemicals, grease, high winds and punctures, and easily accommodates wide temperature extremes. Duro-Last’s custom flashing resists ponding water and helps solve roof problems before they happen. Once installed, a Duro-Last roof is watertight and virtually maintenance-free. Installation Without Disrupting Building Operations Installation is quiet and safe, without loud machinery, hazardous materials, noxious fumes, hot tar, or mess. A new Duro-Last single-ply roof system can often be installed over an existing roof without an expensive tear-off, virtually eliminating debris that could disrupt building activities or damage sensitive equipment. Environmentally Responsible Duro-Last is proud to be a charter partner in the EPA ENERGY STAR® Roof Products Program. Duro-Last is also a charter member of the Cool Roof Rating Council and a member of the US Green Building Council. Our white cool roof membrane starts out with 87% reflectivity and is highly-reflective throughout its life span on the roof, saving significant energy and money for building owners and managers all over North America. Backed By Industry’s Best Warranties Duro-Last protects building with a comprehensive 15-year No Dollar Limit (NDL) warranty that clearly states our coverage of consequential damages that result from defects in the Duro-Last material and/or installation workmanship. Duro-Last also has 20-year warranties available.

  title: 'What is PVC roofing?',
	description:'Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) roofing, is a single-ply membrane used on flat or low-sloped roof surfaces. PVC roofing systems are typically comprised of two layers of PVC film and a fabric scrim that provides strength and durability. While available in a wide range of colors, white PVC roofs offer superior reflectivity compared to darker roofing systems, and PVC roofs are effective in all climates. Additionally, PVC membranes are flexible, lightweight, resistant to most chemicals, and self-extinguish after fire exposure.

				While commercial roofing systems and residential roofs share the same primary function of protecting your
				property or residence from the elements, that’s where the similarities end. The most significant difference
				between commercial roofing systems and residential roofing is the slope of the roof which is determined by the
				size of the building. Because residences are smaller, they typically have a steep slope roof that is visible
				from the ground and uses materials such as architectural tile, asphalt shingles, and slate. Given the larger
				size of commercial buildings, commercial roofs tend to have flat or only slightly sloped roofs which are not
				visible from the ground. Commercial roofs come in a wide range of materials which are determined by the
				structure of the building and other factors like climatic conditions, e.g., intense heat, extreme cold, or if a
				surface needs to withstand high foot traffic.
			</p>

			<h1 className=''>Commercial Roofing Materials and Modern Technology</h1>
			<p className=''>
				Commercial roofing contractors keep abreast of the advances in commercial roofing technology and are
				knowledgeable on the best roofing solution based on the needs of the project. In recent years, new commercial
				roofing products have been introduced that provide high resistance to temperature extremes and optimize
				environmental efficiency, helping to reduce stormwater runoff and heating and cooling expenses.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Choosing a Commercial Roofing System</h2>
			<p className=''>
				There are factors to consider when choosing the type of commercial roofing system you’ll need for your business.
				You need to consider the type of facility you are working with as well since different types of businesses
				require specific planning. Becoming familiar with the types of commercial roofing systems that are available
				will help in your decision-making process.
			</p>
			<h2 className=''>Shape of Commercial Roofs</h2>
			<p className=''>
				With commercial roofing systems, addressing the slope of the roof is important. Roofs are classified as Low
				Slope Roofs (or Flat Roofs) and Steep Slope Roofs. Low Slope Roofs: These roofing systems are common among
				warehouses, big box stores, and shopping centers. With this roofing system, there are several options for flat
				roofs including EPDM, PVC, and TPO. .. Steep Slope Roofs: These roofing systems are more commonly seen on single
				and multi-family homes than they are on commercial properties. With this roofing system, popular roof materials
				include metal, shingles, slate or tile.
			</p>
			<h2 className=''>Types of Commercial Roofing Systems</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Once you have identified the roof’s slope, you are ready to select the type of roofing system that best meets
				the needs of your business. Below are the most common commercial roofing systems.
			</p>
			<h3 className=''>Single Ply Roofing</h3>
			<p className=''>
				These roof systems use TPO, PVC, and EPDM. They are incredibly flexible, robust, materials preferred by many
				building owners because it resists peeling, cracking and other types of weathering. Their main characteristic is
				they are designed to be installed in a single layer. There are two main categories within the single-ply roofing
				industry – thermoplastic membranes and thermoset membranes.
			</p>

			<h3 className=''>TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)</h3>
			<p className=''>
				This material is most commonly used on low slope roofs in North America and includes reinforced roof sheets that
				feature heat-welded seams and are highly reflective. TPO is a single-ply membrane, typically composed of
				polypropylene and ethylene-propylene rubber that has been polymerized together. TPO is part of the thermoplastic
				membrane category and comes in a variety of colors, although the most popular are white, grey, and tan. The
				membrane can be installed using several different methods including mechanically attached, adhered, or
				ballasted.
			</p>
			<h3 className=''>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</h3>
			<p className=''>
				PVC roofing material is composed of two layers of PVC with a polyester reinforcement scrim in between. The top
				ply contains additives that make the membrane UV resistant. The bottom ply is typically darker and contains
				plasticizers for flexibility which helps make installation easier. Other benefits of a PVC membrane are
				longevity, durability, and fire resistance. PVC is also weldable which means it can be welded to an adjoining
				sheet making it watertight. PVC sheets can be made to resemble a standing seam roof system by welding a
				pre-manufactured rib to the surface which creates a visually appealing aesthetic for a much lower price point.
				PVC membranes are also recyclable and can be reused in new sheets.
			</p>
			<h3 className=''> EPDM Roofing (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)</h3>
			<p className=''>
				What is EPDM roofing? The letters stand for “ethylene propylene diene monomer,” a tough-to-pronounce chemical
				compound that is known for its elasticity and toughness. EPDM roofing employs a material that has a fantastic
				ability to resist the constant bombardment of ultraviolet light and all the sun’s damaging rays. One of the most
				popular commercial roofing materials in current use, EPDM rubber roofing is doubly desirable because it combines
				low cost with resilient strength. An EPDM roofing membrane is a type of synthetic rubber composed of natural gas
				and oil. EPDM roofing material is used in low-slope commercial buildings all over the world.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Modified Bitumen Roofing Systems</h2>
			<p className=''>
				A modified bitumen roof combines asphalt and a unique chemical polymer for flexibility and temperature
				resistance. It can be applied in multiple layers, in several ways (self-adhesive sheets, hot-mopped asphalt,
				torch applied or cold-applied adhesives), in both hot and cold temperatures, making it a viable option for
				installation through all four seasons. The seams are melted together to form a secure bond. They are rated
				against wind, fire, and hail which means they are resistant to damage during a storm.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Built-Up Roofing Systems</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Among the oldest roofing systems available on the market, built-up roofing consists of 3-5 layers for enhanced
				protection, especially in extreme climatic conditions with wide ranges of low and high temperatures. Sometimes
				called BUR for short, built-up roofing has been around for more than 100 years.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Metal Roofs</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Metal roofing is known for its aesthetics, longevity, and durability. Used on both low-slope and steep roofs,
				many building owners prefer the look and durability that comes with metal roofs. Building and homeowners are now
				opting for certain types of metal roofs to take advantage of the longer lifespan and durability compared to a
				traditional shingle roof.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Liquid Applied Roofing</h2>
			<p className=''>
				A liquid applied roofing membrane is constructed in place with resin and a reinforcing polyester. It offers
				superior waterproofing capabilities because it’s able to reach those harder to get to areas. It is sprayed on,
				or roller applied, usually in two separate coats. A liquid roof, due to the nature of how it is applied doesn’t
				create invasive disturbances and or emit harmful or strong odors, making it a good option for when businesses
				need to stay open during construction.
			</p>

			<h1 className=''>Roof Coating Systems </h1>
			<h2 className=''></h2>
			<p className=''>
				This fully adhered coating consists of a fluid-applied membrane. It can stretch and return to its original
				shape. There are many types of roof coatings, but the most common include acrylic and silicone. Best suited for
				metal roofs, coatings can help keep buildings cool, reduce energy consumption, protect against leaks and extend
				the life of a commercial roof.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Green Roofs</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Green roofs are not suitable for every space. But when in place, they can help to reduce energy costs with
				natural insulation, create enjoyable spaces for people and animals, and absorb stormwater, arguably lessening
				the need for complex and expensive drainage systems. Green roofs, in general, improve air quality and help
				reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect. Nations Roof® has installed many green or vegetative roofing systems across
				the country.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Solar panels absorb natural sunlight and convert it into usable energy. In roofing, photovoltaics have the
				potential to generate long-term cost savings to the users, especially in high-sun geographic regions. When
				installing a rooftop photovoltaic system, Nations Roof® can help you maintain the integrity of the roofing
				system to keep your building watertight without interrupting the service of the PV system.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Steep Slope</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Steep slope roofing refers to roofing materials suitable for roofs that have slopes of 3:12 or higher. While
				this is mainly seen in residential properties, commercial buildings sometimes have this style of roof, usually
				because it’s a design feature of the building, e.g., a hotel or university. The roof slope affects the materials
				that can be used which range from asphalt composition roll, fiberglass 3-tab shingle, fiberglass laminate
				(architectural) shingle, specialty asphalt shingle, through to wood shakes, wood shingle, clay, concrete tile,
				slate, and metal.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>Insulation & Cover Boards</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Cover boards and thermal insulations enable a roof to improve the energy efficiency of your building and lower
				your utility bills. The perfect time to add insulation and meet current energy codes is when the roof is being
				replaced.
			</p>

			<h2 className=''>The Less-Than-10-Percent Group</h2>
			<p className=''>Liquid Applied and Spray Foam Roofing Systems - low permeability and require uniform thickness</p>
			<p className=''>Metal Roofing Systems - typically a much larger upfront investment</p>
			<p className=''>
				Vegetative Roof Systems - with a membrane system base, can effectively provide an advantageous means for storm
				water control
			</p>

			<h1 className=''>The Basics on Asphalt Roofing Systems</h1>
			<p className=''>
				Along with a select number of other well-known manufacturers, IKO Industries offers a full line of asphalt based
				commercial roofing systems. A long-dependable choice for low slope roofing, asphalt falls into three basic
				categories: Built Up Roofing, Modified Bitumen and Hybrid Systems (a combination of Mod Bit and BUR). From SBS
				to APP and BUR, IKO’s asphalt applied membrane systems include base sheets, cap sheets and self-adhered
				membranes.
			</p>
			<h2 className=''>Built Up Roofing (BUR) Systems</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Popular in North America for more than 100 years, Built Up Roofing (BUR) Systems are composed of alternating
				layers of bitumen (asphalt) and fabrics called roofing felts. The felts are reinforced with either glass-fiber
				mats or organic mats (ply sheets) and when joined with the bitumen form a durable roofing membrane. The number
				of “plies” on a roof implies the number of layers, i.e. "four plies" denotes a four-layer flat roof membrane
				system. <img className='' src='https://www.iko.com/comm/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/bur-1.jpg' alt='' />
				BUR systems are redundant, meaning if one layer breaks down, multiple remaining layers provide immediate
				protection. These systems also offer great tolerance for building stress and resistance to thermal shock, high
				puncture resistance and outstanding membrane strength and toughness for proven long-term durability.

			<h2 className=''>The Value of Insulation and Vapor Retarders</h2>
			<p className=''>
				Insulation is a vitally important component in roof systems, serving several ancillary functions in addition to
				the primary purpose of energy conservation, often leading to a reduction in heating and cooling costs.
				Insulating materials are designed to reduce the flow of heat, either from or into a building and generally
				installed either just below or immediately above the roofing membrane, depending on the roofing system employed.
				Insulation types include rigid or semi-rigid boards or panels of extruded or expanded polystyrene,
				polyisocyanurate, fiberboard, fiber glass and various composite insulations. Polyisocyanurate (polyiso) is a
				closed-cell, rigid foam board insulation used in roof and wall assemblies within commercial and residential
				buildings of all types. Because of its high thermal performance, it is the product of choice for energy-aware
				architects, specifiers, builders, building owners, contractors and consumers. As one of North America’s most
				widely used, readily available and cost-effective insulation products, Polyiso has been cited by the U.S.
				Environmental Protection Agency for its responsible impact on the environment. As an example, IKOTherm
				Insulation and Cover Boards are dimensionally stable and compatible with a variety of roofing systems. While
				insulation is an important part of a roof system, it can increase the probability of entrapping water within the
				roof assembly. This threat of condensation creates the possible need for another roof-system component: a vapour
				retarder or vapour barrier. Vapour retarders are designed to intercept the flow of water vapor into the
				insulation, where it can reduce the insulation’s thermal resistance, form a source of leaking water, and
				possibly destroy the insulation itself. The IKO MVP Modified Vapour Protector is a vapour retarder that creates
				a moisture trap, preventing the venting of vapour downward into the building interior during changing weather.

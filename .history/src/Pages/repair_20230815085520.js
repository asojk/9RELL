            <h2>signs that it is time for a repair</h2>
            <p>
              Whether from faulty installation, storm damage, or simply an
              outdated roofing system, there are a variety of reasons you may
              need a flat roof repair. Signs of damage are not always obvious,
              either, which is why it is important to get a professional roof
              inspection to uncover even the smallest of damage on your roof.
              Some common signs you may need a flat roof repair include:
            </p>

            <li>Pooling water</li>
            <li>Flashing separation</li>
            <li>Membrane rips</li>
            <li>Coating cracks</li>
            <li>Loose or missing fasteners</li>
            <li>Roof or ceiling leaks</li>

            <p>
              If you are experiencing any of the issues above or even another
              type of problem with your flat roof, contact us today for a free
              inspection.

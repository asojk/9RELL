    Whether you are making updates to commercial buildings or have new builds in the works, the type of commercial roof you choose can have a big impact on long-term costs. 
	Learn about the best types of{' '}<a>commercial roofing</a>{' '} materials and the pros & cons of each.
  </p>
  <h2>Commercial Roof Types: Comparison Between Flat or Sloped</h2>
  <p>
    While flat is the most common commercial roofing material, there is no such thing as a completely flat roof. All types of commercial roofs need to have a gradual slope in the middle or towards the edges to allow for drainage. Without this slope, it would be unrealistic to prevent and remove water and debris build up. When you choose a reliable commercial roofing contractor, they will know that flat roof materials should still be set up with a slight pitch.
  </p>
  <h3>Flat Commercial Roofing Systems</h3>
  <p>
    Flat roofs are by far the preferred type of roofs on commercial buildings because they are more cost-effective than a sloped roof. Additionally, the size of most commercial buildings would make a pitched roof dangerous or inefficient. Here are some more things to consider when choosing a flat type of roof on a commercial building:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Flat roofs are easier to install. Since there’s no steep slopes, there’s less risk and liability to commercial roofing contractors when installing flat roofing materials.
    </li>
    <li>
      There’s less material, so flat roofs are less expensive to install. This is just one of the reasons flat types of roofs on commercial buildings are more cost-effective than a sloped roof.
    </li>
    <li>
      Flat roofs allow for extra storage. Oftentimes, businesses will opt for commercial flat roof materials so they can store their HVAC system on top of the building instead of down below. Keeping these systems out of the way looks nicer for the business front and keeps maintenance and tuneups more discreet.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Cons:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Flat commercial roofs have poor drainage. Like we mentioned, having a slope can help with water run-off and limiting excess water build-up. The pressure from pooled up water over time could lead to a roof leak if gone unnoticed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Debris collection is much more likely on flat roofs. Not only is it harder to spot a miscellaneous item on a flat commercial roofing system, it’s unlikely the debris will fall off on its own, so debris will collect on the roof until it’s cleared.
    </li>
    <li>
      Commercial flat roof materials require more maintenance. Not only will businesses with flat roof types need more maintenance because of water and debris clean-up, commercial roofing contractors will also need to perform maintenance checks to ensure the seals remain watertight to prevent leaks. In addition, some types of commercial roofing materials need to be reapplied to prolong the life of the roof.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sloped Commercial Roofs</h3>
  <p>
    While even flat roofs have the faintest pitch, it’s extremely uncommon for commercial buildings to have a sloped roof similar to what is seen on residential properties. While homeowners prefer these types of roofs for curb appeal, businesses often opt out of sloped types of roofs on commercial buildings. Here’s a few factors to keep in mind when considering a pitched roof:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong> Sloped roofs have better drainage and less debris build-up than a flat roof, which means less need for maintenance visits.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> Commercial roofing systems with slopes could be hazardous depending on the incline of the pitch. Even though you’ll need less maintenance, it can be more difficult for commercial roofing contractors to safely work on the roof, making it more expensive to perform routine maintenance.
  </p>
  <h2>Choosing Your Commercial Roofing Materials</h2>
  <p>
    When checking out various commercial roof types for comparison, many businesses pay close attention to the price differentiation of the various commercial roofing materials, but cost is just one factor to consider when making this large investment. Understanding the{' '} <a href='/blog/how-long-does-a-roof-last-warning-signs-you-need-a-new-roof' target='_self'>   expected lifespan of a roof </a>{' '} is important to ensure you’re getting the most out of your property investment and you’ll have protection for many years before requiring another roof replacement.
  </p>
  <h3>What is the best commercial roofing material?</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend investing in commercial roofing systems that are durable and can provide protection for an extended period of time, but there are many things that could determine what’s the best option for your business. Property investors should consider circumstances such as weather, elements, aesthetics, maintenance, if the roof needs to be accessible and more.{' '}
  </p>
  <h3>What are commercial roofs made of?</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on the commercial roof type, flat roofs can be made from rubber, asphalt, spray foam, metal and synthetic materials. Learn more about the various materials used for the different types of roofs on commercial buildings:{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Thermoplastic Polyolefin (TPO):</strong> The most cost effective option is a single-ply TPO roofing material. This commercial roofing system has strong seams to avoid water leaks but is not as flexible as other materials and seams can wear out in excessive heat. These flat roofs will need to be replaced about every 10-20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Built-Up Roofing Systems (BUR):</strong> One of the most common types of commercial roofs are BUR systems. They use alternating layers of reinforcing fabric and asphalt, then have a gravel or stone layer on top. This multiple layer system can provide additional protection for your commercial roof and typically this type of commercial roof will last between 15-20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Modified Bitumen (MB):</strong> This is an asphalt-based commercial roofing material made for flat and low-slope roofs. This type of commercial roof is quite durable due to its multiple layers and can withstand a wide variety of temperatures. MB roofs have a lifespan of approximately 20 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC):</strong> PVC is a classic flat commercial roofing material with a vinyl membrane. It is UV-resistant and will last well over 25 years, but this type of roof is more expensive than other options.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM):</strong> This option is made of synthetic rubber materials, and it is usually easy for commercial roofing contractors to apply but is not the most attractive type of commercial roof. EPDM is a great affordable option that will last approximately 25-30 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Metal:</strong> Whether you’re interested in a metal roof for a commercial or residential property, its durability depends on the thickness of the material. Thick and sturdy metals will be more expensive, but those types of roofs on commercial buildings can last over 50 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Spray Foam:</strong> Similar to metal roofs, this commercial roof type’s life expectancy is determined by the thickness of the foam. Spray foam commercial roofing systems can also last longer if recoating maintenance is performed. Spray foam roofing is energy efficient and easy to install, but requires specific weather conditions for installation, so it can be hard to find an ideal time. An investment in a spray foam commercial roof should last well over 50 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our commercial roofing contractors recommend considering the longevity of your investment in mind as well as the cost of installation and maintenance when choosing the best commercial roof type for your properties. While some options may be cost effective initially, it’s important to consider how many years the roof will last and how frequently you’d like to replace your commercial roofing materials.
  </p>
  <p className=''>
    While commercial roofing systems and residential roofs share the same primary function of protecting your property or residence from the elements, that’s where the similarities end. The most significant difference between commercial roofing systems and residential roofing is the slope of the roof which is determined by the size of the building. Because residences are smaller, they typically have a steep slope roof that is visible from the ground and uses materials such as architectural tile, asphalt shingles, and slate. Given the larger size of commercial buildings, commercial roofs tend to have flat or only slightly sloped roofs which are not visible from the ground. Commercial roofs come in a wide range of materials which are determined by the structure of the building and other factors like climatic conditions, e.g., intense heat, extreme cold, or if a surface needs to withstand high foot traffic.
  </p>
  <h1 className=''>Commercial Roofing Materials and Modern Technology</h1>
  <p className=''>
    Commercial roofing contractors keep abreast of the advances in commercial roofing technology and are knowledgeable on the best roofing solution based on the needs of the project. In recent years, new commercial roofing products have been introduced that provide high resistance to temperature extremes and optimize environmental efficiency, helping to reduce stormwater runoff and heating and cooling expenses.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Choosing a Commercial Roofing System</h2>
  <p className=''>
    There are factors to consider when choosing the type of commercial roofing system you’ll need for your business. You need to consider the type of facility you are working with as well since different types of businesses require specific planning. Becoming familiar with the types of commercial roofing systems that are available will help in your decision-making process.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Shape of Commercial Roofs</h2>
  <p className=''>
    With commercial roofing systems, addressing the slope of the roof is important. Roofs are classified as Low Slope Roofs (or Flat Roofs) and Steep Slope Roofs. Low Slope Roofs: These roofing systems are common among warehouses, big box stores, and shopping centers. With this roofing system, there are several options for flat roofs including EPDM, PVC, and TPO. .. Steep Slope Roofs: These roofing systems are more commonly seen on single and multi-family homes than they are on commercial properties. With this roofing system, popular roof materials include metal, shingles, slate or tile.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Types of Commercial Roofing Systems</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Once you have identified the roof’s slope, you are ready to select the type of roofing system that best meets the needs of your business. Below are the most common commercial roofing systems.
  </p>
  <h3 className=''>Single Ply Roofing</h3>
  <p className=''>
    These roof systems use TPO, PVC, and EPDM. They are incredibly flexible, robust, materials preferred by many building owners because it resists peeling, cracking and other types of weathering. Their main characteristic is they are designed to be installed in a single layer. There are two main categories within the single-ply roofing industry – thermoplastic membranes and thermoset membranes.
  </p>
  <h3 className=''>TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)</h3>
  <p className=''>
    This material is most commonly used on low slope roofs in North America and includes reinforced roof sheets that feature heat-welded seams and are highly reflective. TPO is a single-ply membrane, typically composed of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene rubber that has been polymerized together. TPO is part of the thermoplastic membrane category and comes in a variety of colors, although the most popular are white, grey, and tan. The membrane can be installed using several different methods including mechanically attached, adhered, or ballasted.
  </p>
  <h3 className=''>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</h3>
  <p className=''>
    PVC roofing material is composed of two layers of PVC with a polyester reinforcement scrim in between. The top ply contains additives that make the membrane UV resistant. The bottom ply is typically darker and contains plasticizers for flexibility which helps make installation easier. Other benefits of a PVC membrane are longevity, durability, and fire resistance. PVC is also weldable which means it can be welded to an adjoining sheet making it watertight. PVC sheets can be made to resemble a standing seam roof system by welding a pre-manufactured rib to the surface which creates a visually appealing aesthetic for a much lower price point. PVC membranes are also recyclable and can be reused in new sheets.
  </p>
  <h3 className=''> EPDM Roofing (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)</h3>
  <p className=''>
    What is EPDM roofing? The letters stand for “ethylene propylene diene monomer,” a tough-to-pronounce chemical compound that is known for its elasticity and toughness. EPDM roofing employs a material that has a fantastic ability to resist the constant bombardment of ultraviolet light and all the sun’s damaging rays. One of the most popular commercial roofing materials in current use, EPDM rubber roofing is doubly desirable because it combines low cost with resilient strength. An EPDM roofing membrane is a type of synthetic rubber composed of natural gas and oil. EPDM roofing material is used in low-slope commercial buildings all over the world.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Modified Bitumen Roofing Systems</h2>
  <p className=''>
    A modified bitumen roof combines asphalt and a unique chemical polymer for flexibility and temperature resistance. It can be applied in multiple layers, in several ways (self-adhesive sheets, hot-mopped asphalt, torch applied or cold-applied adhesives), in both hot and cold temperatures, making it a viable option for installation through all four seasons. The seams are melted together to form a secure bond. They are rated against wind, fire, and hail which means they are resistant to damage during a storm.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Built-Up Roofing Systems</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Among the oldest roofing systems available on the market, built-up roofing consists of 3-5 layers for enhanced protection, especially in extreme climatic conditions with wide ranges of low and high temperatures. Sometimes called BUR for short, built-up roofing has been around for more than 100 years.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Metal Roofs</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Metal roofing is known for its aesthetics, longevity, and durability. Used on both low-slope and steep roofs, many building owners prefer the look and durability that comes with metal roofs. Building and homeowners are now opting for certain types of metal roofs to take advantage of the longer lifespan and durability compared to a traditional shingle roof.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Liquid Applied Roofing</h2>
  <p className=''>
    A liquid applied roofing membrane is constructed in place with resin and a reinforcing polyester. It offers superior waterproofing capabilities because it’s able to reach those harder to get to areas. It is sprayed on, or roller applied, usually in two separate coats. A liquid roof, due to the nature of how it is applied doesn’t create invasive disturbances and or emit harmful or strong odors, making it a good option for when businesses need to stay open during construction.
  </p>
  <h1 className=''>Roof Coating Systems </h1>
  <h2 className=''></h2>
  <p className=''>
    This fully adhered coating consists of a fluid-applied membrane. It can stretch and return to its original shape. There are many types of roof coatings, but the most common include acrylic and silicone. Best suited for metal roofs, coatings can help keep buildings cool, reduce energy consumption, protect against leaks and extend the life of a commercial roof.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Green Roofs</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Green roofs are not suitable for every space. But when in place, they can help to reduce energy costs with natural insulation, create enjoyable spaces for people and animals, and absorb stormwater, arguably lessening the need for complex and expensive drainage systems. Green roofs, in general, improve air quality and help reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect. Nations Roof® has installed many green or vegetative roofing systems across the country.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Solar panels absorb natural sunlight and convert it into usable energy. In roofing, photovoltaics have the potential to generate long-term cost savings to the users, especially in high-sun geographic regions. When installing a rooftop photovoltaic system, Nations Roof® can help you maintain the integrity of the roofing system to keep your building watertight without interrupting the service of the PV system.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Steep Slope</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Steep slope roofing refers to roofing materials suitable for roofs that have slopes of 3:12 or higher. While this is mainly seen in residential properties, commercial buildings sometimes have this style of roof, usually because it’s a design feature of the building, e.g., a hotel or university. The roof slope affects the materials that can be used which range from asphalt composition roll, fiberglass 3-tab shingle, fiberglass laminate (architectural) shingle, specialty asphalt shingle, through to wood shakes, wood shingle, clay, concrete tile, slate, and metal.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Insulation & Cover Boards</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Cover boards and thermal insulations enable a roof to improve the energy efficiency of your building and lower your utility bills. The perfect time to add insulation and meet current energy codes is when the roof is being replaced.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>The Less-Than-10-Percent Group</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Liquid Applied and Spray Foam Roofing Systems - low permeability and require uniform thickness
  </p>
  <p className=''>Metal Roofing Systems - typically a much larger upfront investment</p>
  <p className=''>
    Vegetative Roof Systems - with a membrane system base, can effectively provide an advantageous means for storm water control
  </p>
  <p className=''></p>
  <p className=''></p>
  <h1 className=''>The Basics on Asphalt Roofing Systems</h1>
  <p className=''>
    Along with a select number of other well-known manufacturers, IKO Industries offers a full line of asphalt based commercial roofing systems. A long-dependable choice for low slope roofing, asphalt falls into three basic categories: Built Up Roofing, Modified Bitumen and Hybrid Systems (a combination of Mod Bit and BUR). From SBS to APP and BUR, IKO’s asphalt applied membrane systems include base sheets, cap sheets and self-adhered membranes.
  </p>
  <h2 className=''>Built Up Roofing (BUR) Systems</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Popular in North America for more than 100 years, Built Up Roofing (BUR) Systems are composed of alternating layers of bitumen (asphalt) and fabrics called roofing felts. The felts are reinforced with either glass-fiber mats or organic mats (ply sheets) and when joined with the bitumen form a durable roofing membrane. The number of “plies” on a roof implies the number of layers, i.e. "four plies" denotes a four-layer flat roof membrane system. <img className='' src='https://www.iko.com/comm/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/bur-1.jpg' alt='' /> BUR systems are redundant, meaning if one layer breaks down, multiple remaining layers provide immediate protection. These systems also offer great tolerance for building stress and resistance to thermal shock, high puncture resistance and outstanding membrane strength and toughness for proven long-term durability.

  <h2 className=''>The Value of Insulation and Vapor Retarders</h2>
  <p className=''>
    Insulation is a vitally important component in roof systems, serving several ancillary functions in addition to the primary purpose of energy conservation, often leading to a reduction in heating and cooling costs. Insulating materials are designed to reduce the flow of heat, either from or into a building and generally installed either just below or immediately above the roofing membrane, depending on the roofing system employed. Insulation types include rigid or semi-rigid boards or panels of extruded or expanded polystyrene, polyisocyanurate, fiberboard, fiber glass and various composite insulations. Polyisocyanurate (polyiso) is a closed-cell, rigid foam board insulation used in roof and wall assemblies within commercial and residential buildings of all types. Because of its high thermal performance, it is the product of choice for energy-aware architects, specifiers, builders, building owners, contractors and consumers. As one of North America’s most widely used, readily available and cost-effective insulation products, Polyiso has been cited by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its responsible impact on the environment. As an example, IKOTherm Insulation and Cover Boards are dimensionally stable and compatible with a variety of roofing systems. While insulation is an important part of a roof system, it can increase the probability of entrapping water within the roof assembly. This threat of condensation creates the possible need for another roof-system component: a vapour retarder or vapour barrier. Vapour retarders are designed to intercept the flow of water vapor into the insulation, where it can reduce the insulation’s thermal resistance, form a source of leaking water, and possibly destroy the insulation itself. The IKO MVP Modified Vapour Protector is a vapour retarder that creates a moisture trap, preventing the venting of vapour downward into the building interior during changing weather.

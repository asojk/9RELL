        signs that it is time for a replacement
      </span>
      <p className="replace-text">
        It can be hard to know when it is time to get a new flat roof, and
        certainly, it can be quite an investment. What is even more costly,
        though, is not replacing a damaged roof which can lead to further issues
        and even more expenses. If you experience any of the signs below, it may
        be time to schedule your flat roof replacement:
        <ul>
          <br />
          <li>Multiple roof holes</li>
          <li>Leaking ceiling</li>
          <li>Torn vapor barrier</li>
          <li>Missing pieces of roof</li>
          <li>Pooling water</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The only way to be sure if your roof is still in good shape is to hire a
        professional. Contact Grell today for a free roofing inspection to see
        if a roof replacement is the next step for maintaining your building.

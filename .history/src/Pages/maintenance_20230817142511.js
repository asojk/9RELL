        Whether from faulty installation, storm damage, or simply an outdated roofing system, there are a variety of reasons you may need a flat roof repair. Signs of damage are not always obvious, either, which is why it is important to get a professional roof inspection to uncover even the smallest of damage on your roof. Some common signs you may need a flat roof repair include:</p>

            As a commercial property owner, we understand that you don’t have
            time to constantly keep up with your roof maintenance. You may not
            even know how to. Leave that up to us and sign up for one of our
            flat roof maintenance contracts. Among other benefits, we inspect
            your roof every year, report any problems, and also provide
            solutions on how to best address them. This way, you have one less
            thing to worry about, and you’re positioned to save time and money.

            What Is Included In The Yearly Flat Roof Inspection?
          </span>
          <p className="replace-text">
            As part of our maintenance program, you will receive a free basic
            preventative maintenance inspection every year to ensure your roof
            is performing as it should. When one of our technicians arrives at
            your property for an inspection, you can expect them to do the
            following:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>Inspect critical areas of your roof</li>
              <li>
                Clean environmental debris from waterways to promote drainage
              </li>
              <li>
                Report any damages or maintenance issues that need to be
                addressed
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            Without any effort on your end, a yearly flat roof inspection will
            allow you to be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to
            protecting your business.

            <p className="replace-text">
              Whether from faulty installation, storm damage, or simply an outdated
              roofing system, there are a variety of reasons you may need a flat roof
              repair. Signs of damage are not always obvious, either, which is why
              it is important to get a professional roof inspection to uncover even the
              smallest of damage on your roof. Some common signs you may need a flat
              roof repair include:
              <ul>
                <li>Pooling water</li>
                <li>Flashing separation</li>
                <li>Membrane rips</li>
                <li>Coating cracks</li>
                <li>Loose or missing fasteners</li>
                <li>Roof or ceiling leaks</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              If you are experiencing any of the issues above or even another type of
              problem with your flat roof, contact us today for a free inspection.

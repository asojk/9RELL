			"I've used Grell roofing on several occasions. Each time they have been extremely prompt with their bids, on doing the work on schedule, and with no call backs. Their team is on point, always getting the job done right and on time. What I really appreciate is how they keep things clear and straightforward. No fluff, just honest work. They get what we need and they deliver, no fuss. The quality of their work speaks for itself. The roofs they've put up are solid and look great. They've definitely become our go-to for all things roofing. So, if you're looking for a reliable, top-quality roofing service, I'd say check out Grell Commercial Roofing. They've got it down to a T.",

			'I work for a business in which we contract out for things beyond our expertise, so we have used Grell Roofing several times, projects big & small. They recently came out the same day I called, on a rainy day of all days, to check out an issue for a client of ours. Turned out to not even be roofing related and they still temporarily patched it until our guys could get back there. THAT is going above & beyond, with exceptional customer service, especially by the young man who came out, communicated with me the whole time and their office manager, who returns my messages asap and is super friendly! We will continue using Grell Roofing for our business plus I will definitely reach out & recommend them personally!',
